# mapReduceCharCounter
Simple: vowel counter, from a input string using map reduce.


# naive solution:

Running example: Count all the vowels from text.txt
works:
  We need a mapper and a reducer.
Solution:
  The mapper will count the number of vowels in each line, for each vowel.
  The reducer will take the counts for each vowel from each line and total all the counts.
